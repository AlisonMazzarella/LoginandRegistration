# PracticeCPlusPlus
Create a basic program that highlights different things you can do using C++.  

# Overview

The program I wrote demonstrates how to use C++ to read and write to a .txt file. It also demonstrates how to add libraries, declare functions, declare a class, and use variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and using a list. 

While I have some knowledge and experience with object-orientated programming languages like Python, I have no prior experience with C++. My purpose for creating a program with C++ was to understand the similarities and differences between it and Python and to also learn how to write basic programs using it. I am also rather new to using Visual Studio; I mostly only use it for .NET and C#, so getting more practice with it is also beneficial to my learning goals.
